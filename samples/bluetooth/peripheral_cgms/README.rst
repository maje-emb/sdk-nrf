The Peripheral Continuous Glucose Monitoring Service (CGMS) sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`cgms_readme` to implement a glucose monitoring device.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

.. include:: /includes/tfm.txt

Overview
********

The sample demonstrates a basic BluetoothÂ® Low Energy Peripheral role functionality that exposes the Continuous Glucose Monitoring GATT Service.
Once it connects to a Central device, it generates dummy glucose measurement values.
You can use the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ to interact with the CGMS module.

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/bluetooth/peripheral_cgms`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, test it by performing the following steps:

1. |connect_terminal_specific|
#. Reset the development kit.
#. Start the `nRF Connect for Mobile`_ application on your smartphone or tablet.
#. Connect to the device from the application.
   The device is advertising as ``Nordic Glucose Sensor``.
   The services of the connected device are shown.
#. In :guilabel:`Continuous Glucose Monitoring` Service, tap the :guilabel:`Notify` button for the "CGMS Measurement" characteristic.
   Authentication is required.
   The device prints the pairing key in the terminal.
#. Enter the pairing key on the client side.
#. If pairing is successful, in the terminal window, observe that notifications are enabled::

      <inf> cgms: CGMS Measurement: notification enabled

#. Observe that notifications with the measurement values are received.
#. The glucose measurement is sent to the client using a notification.
   The client can also retrieve the record using the record access control point.
